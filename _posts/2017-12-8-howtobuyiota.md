Before you start you should know a thing or 2

Firstly

Its still very difficult to buy iota straight away with creditcard or banktransfer (with a few exceptions, described below).

Secondly

For most users, you gonna need to buy one of the following cryptocoins in order to buy iota on an exchange platform. So before you can buy any iota you will need to learn how to buy bitcoin, ethereum or litecoin.

Consider the following before you buy any of the 3 choices.


Bitcoin: high fees low speed: 3/7 transactions per Secondly (you can buy iota straight away on your prefered exchange)

Ethereum: lower fees higher speed: 20 transactions per Secondly (you can buy iota straight away on your prefered exchange)

Litecoin: lowest fees highest speed: 56 transaction per second (con: you have to sell it for btc, usd, or eth on the choosen exchange before you can buy iota)



For most countries you can choose one of following options

option 1

Globally

localbitcoins > binance / bitfinex

option 2

Mainly Western Countries

Coinbase is very straightforward and should not be a struggle for beginners in the cryptospace.

coinbase > binance / bitfinex

If you follow https://www.coinbase.com/join/5a2aaf4164509701263e6954 you will earn 10$ for a deposit of 100$

Not possible for asia, middle east, latin america & africa except Singapore

option 3

For the few lucky that have such machine in their neighboorhood

option 4

For those with patience and a visa, most verifications take up to 4 - 6 weeks to finish

You can however buy iota straight from the exchange. But that takes verification.

verify identity on binance / bitfinex > make a deposit and buy with $$$




exceptions:

Germany
